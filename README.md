**Team Members:**  
 * Richard Henderson
 * Zach Cone
 * Jonathan Park
        
**Interested Fields:**  
 * CryptoCurrencies
 * Stock Indices
 * Currency Indices
 * Commodity Prices
 * Other economic data
 
 **Data Sources:**  
 * Kraken API - Cryptocurrency Historical Data○Bitcoin○Ethereum○Ripple●
 * US Treasury - Treasury Bond Yield Historical Data
 * Investing.com - Stock Index & Commodity Historical 
 
 **Data Exploration:**
 * Investigate the correlation of various cryptocurrencies and other economic data such as treasury yields, stock indices and commodity prices to the price 
 action of Bitcoin to determine what data might be useful as inputs for deep learning.

**Questions:**

 * Can the project make a prediction of the future price action of Bitcoin?

 * What are the most relevant features data to use for the project’s machine learning models?

 * Can the project make a prediction of the future price action of different cryptocurrencies or altcoins?

 * Which machine learning model performs the best in train/test scenarios?

**Python Packages:** 
 * Pandas
 * Numpy
 * Sklearn
 * Tensorflow
 * hvplot
 * dontenv
 * os

**Methods:**  The methods we plan to use will include linear regression machine learning models as well as a deep learning model. We want to explore the different models to see which one can best predict the future price of Bitcoin.

**Models:** 
 * Linear Regression
 * XGBoost
 * Cross-Validation
 * Deep Learning Model
 * Deep Tree
 * Chained Multioutput Regression
